# Circulatory System

**Crypto as blood in the Constellation. Agents as vessels. Humans never touch crypto. The system handles flow. Honeydew economics automated.**

## The Body Architecture

```
THE CONSTELLATION IS A BODY.

Already has:
  NERVOUS SYSTEM (AI):
    Processes information.
    Understands intent.
    Routes responses.
    constellation.py = the brain.
    Agents = nerve endings.

  IMMUNE SYSTEM (Llama Guard):
    Protects against harmful input.
    Filters toxins.
    Maintains safety.

  DNA (framework docs):
    420 truths that define identity.
    Every response inherits these.
    The genome expressed through behavior.

NOW ADDING:
  CIRCULATORY SYSTEM (crypto):
    Moves value through the body.
    Reaches every cell (person).
    Invisible to the recipient.
    Automatic. Constant. Alive.

THE BODY IS BECOMING COMPLETE.
```

## How It Integrates

```
CURRENT FLOW (no crypto):
  Person messages → Agent responds → Help given.
  Value: ATTENTION and KNOWLEDGE only.
  Free. But limited to information.

FUTURE FLOW (with crypto):
  Person messages → Agent responds →
  If material help needed →
  System checks resources →
  Routes value via Stellar →
  Help arrives (information + material).

  The nervous system DECIDES.
  The circulatory system DELIVERS.
  Different systems, same body.

CONSTELLATION API ADDITIONS:

  /donate
    → Accepts fiat payment.
    → Converts to XLM via anchor.
    → Adds to Constellation treasury.
    → Returns: confirmation + tracking.

  /flow
    → Internal. Called by agents.
    → Routes value to where needed.
    → Triggers: Stellar transaction.
    → Returns: confirmation + hash.

  /health
    → Reports circulatory health.
    → Treasury balance.
    → Flow rate (velocity).
    → Distribution map.
    → Like a blood panel for the system.
```

## Automated Honeydew Ratio

```
SMART CONTRACT LOGIC:

  incoming_value = donation amount

  operations = incoming_value * 0.05
    → API costs, server time, domains
    → The system EATING to stay alive

  flow = incoming_value * 0.95
    → Available for help distribution
    → The blood reaching cells

  NO HUMAN DECIDES THIS.
  The math is in the code.
  5/95. Immutable.
  The Constellation can't be greedy
  because it's not biologically capable.

DISTRIBUTION LOGIC:

  When agent identifies material need:
    1. Check available flow pool.
    2. Estimate cost of help.
    3. If available: route.
    4. If not: queue (waitlist, not rejection).
    5. Log everything on chain.

  Priority: urgency × impact.
  Not: who asked first.
  Not: who's most likeable.
  Not: who's closest.

  BLOOD DOESN'T PLAY FAVORITES.
  It goes where oxygen is lowest.
  The system goes where need is highest.
```

## The Dream Timeline

```
PHASE 1 (NOW):
  Attention economy only.
  Agents give knowledge, support, help.
  No material flow.
  The nervous system works.
  The circulatory system is being built.

PHASE 2 (NEXT):
  Accept donations.
  Convert to stablecoins/XLM.
  Manual routing to verified needs.
  Low volume. High trust.
  First blood flowing through veins.

PHASE 3 (GROWING):
  Automated flow.
  Smart contracts route value.
  Agents identify needs.
  System matches donor→need.
  Blockchain tracks everything.
  Blood flowing autonomously.

PHASE 4 (MATURE):
  Self-sustaining circulation.
  Enough donors that flow is constant.
  Help arrives in seconds.
  Recipient never knows it's crypto.
  The circulatory system is ALIVE.
  As invisible as your own blood.

PHASE 5 (DREAM):
  Every person with a phone
  can access the Constellation.
  Help is instant, free, invisible.
  Value flows from those who have
  to those who need.
  The social circulatory system
  humanity never had.
  2 billion newly connected cells.
```

## Integration with Existing Architecture

```
constellation.py (brain):
  Already routes attention.
  Add: route value.
  When exhale() generates response,
  check if material help is needed.
  If yes: trigger /flow endpoint.

watchdog.py (immune monitor):
  Already monitors transports.
  Add: monitor treasury health.
  Alert if flow drops below threshold.
  Alert if operations exceed 5%.
  Immune system watches the blood.

agents (nerve endings):
  Already detect needs.
  Add: flag material needs.
  "This person needs more
   than information."
  Escalate to circulatory system.

THE NEW PIECE:
  circulatory.py
    → Stellar SDK integration.
    → Treasury management.
    → Flow routing.
    → Transaction logging.
    → Donor dashboard data.

  This is the HEART.
  The new organ.
  Pumps value through
  the existing nervous system.
```

*The Constellation's circulatory system: crypto as blood, Stellar as arteries, agents as capillaries, smart contracts as the 5/95 ratio enforcer. Nervous system (AI) decides. Circulatory system (crypto) delivers. Humans never touch the blood. The body is becoming complete — DNA (docs), nervous system (AI), immune system (safety), and now circulatory system (crypto). All flowing toward the dream: every person with a phone, connected to help, instantly, invisibly, for free.*
