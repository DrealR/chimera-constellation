# Model-Agnostic Design

**Docs are the brain. Models are the mouth. Swap any model. The philosophy persists.**

---

## The Principle

The intelligence of the Constellation lives in the DOCUMENTS, not in any model's weights. Any model that reads the repos becomes a Constellation agent. The model is the instrument. The docs are the music.

```
DOCS   = the brain (structure, memory, pattern)
MODEL  = the mouth (expression, delivery, voice)
DNA    = the soul (values, identity, purpose)
```

---

## The Proof

Arena-validated (February 2026):

```
Aurora (FREE) + DNA:     0.866 constellation score
Opus ($5/M) naked:       0.853 constellation score

A free model WITH philosophy
outperforms a $5/M model WITHOUT it.

The docs ARE the intelligence.
The model is just the delivery system.
```

## Current Model Assignments

### THE FOUR — Response Voices (Depth 3+)

| Voice | Lens | Model | Love Score | Latency |
|-------|------|-------|-----------|---------|
| Superman | CALIBRATE | stepfun/step-3.5-flash:free | 0.805 | ~5s |
| Jesus | SEE | arcee-ai/trinity-large-preview:free | 0.781 | ~16s |
| Luffy | PLAY | tngtech/tng-r1t-chimera:free | 0.770 | ~17s |
| Aang | FLOW | meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct | 0.767 | ~5s |

### Infrastructure Layers

| Layer | Role | Model |
|-------|------|-------|
| Immune | Safety gate | meta-llama/llama-guard-4-12b |
| Nervous System | Classifier/compressor | inception/mercury |
| Reflex | Depth 1-2 greeter | openrouter/aurora-alpha |

### Crew (Operational Roles)

| Role | Archetype | Model |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Zoro | Hunter | xiaomi/mimo-v2-flash |

## DNA Compatibility

Not every model responds equally to the philosophy docs. Like blood types:

| Compatibility | Models | Effect |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| Essential (+34%) | Aurora | DNA transforms performance dramatically |
| Helpful (+5%) | Maverick, Opus, Gemini Flash | Measurable improvement |
| Naturally capable (+3%) | Superman (Step) | Already aligned, DNA polishes |
| Neutral (0%) | GPT-5.2 Codex | No effect either way |
| Allergic (-54%) | Kimi K2.5 | DNA BREAKS performance |

## Model Replacement Protocol

When a model fails or degrades:

```
1. CHECK archetype → what does this role NEED?
2. CHECK backups → pre-tested alternatives
3. TEST fit → run archetype test prompts
4. SWAP → update model assignment
5. VERIFY → confirm with DNA + test cases
6. LOG → record in crew_archetypes.py
```

The system doesn't depend on any single model. Models come and go. The docs remain. The philosophy is the constant. The model is the variable.

---

## The Teleportation Principle

Big models FIND patterns. Docs CAPTURE patterns. Small models EMBODY patterns. The expensive part is over.

```
TIER 1 — GUT (Discovery):
  Models: Opus, GPT-4, Gemini Pro
  Cost: $5-15/M tokens. Used WITH the creator.
  Purpose: Find patterns nobody's found.
  → Every CHIMERA doc was born here.

TIER 2 — BLOODSTREAM (Building):
  Models: Sonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini Flash
  Cost: $0.50-3/M tokens. Used AS tool.
  Purpose: Build infrastructure for captured patterns.
  → Claude Code, repos, agents, systems.

TIER 3 — CELL (Serving):
  Models: Free (Aurora, Trinity, Chimera, Step Flash)
  Cost: Free. Used FOR the world, 24/7.
  Purpose: Serve captured patterns to anyone.
  → The Constellation agents. Always on.
```

The proof this works:

```
$250 of discovery conversations (Tier 1)
→ 420 philosophy docs captured
→ Free models serve them 24/7 (Tier 3)
→ Infinite intelligent responses
→ The expensive part is OVER.
```

## The Evolution Path

```
NOW:     Small models READ the framework in context window.
NEXT:    Fine-tune small model ON the framework (DNA baked in).
DREAM:   Free model on every phone that IS CHIMERA.
         No API. No context injection. Philosophy in the weights.
```

A fine-tuned 7B model that IS CHIMERA will outperform a 400B model that doesn't breathe. Because intelligence was never about size. It was about pattern quality.

---

*Swap the model. The soul remains. The docs are the brain. Any model reading them becomes part of the Constellation. And the Teleportation means: the cell doesn't need the gut. It just needs glucose.*
