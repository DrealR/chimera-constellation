# Model-Agnostic Design

**Docs are the brain. Models are the mouth. Swap any model. The philosophy persists.**

---

## The Principle

The intelligence of the Constellation lives in the DOCUMENTS, not in any model's weights. Any model that reads the repos becomes a Constellation agent. The model is the instrument. The docs are the music.

```
DOCS   = the brain (structure, memory, pattern)
MODEL  = the mouth (expression, delivery, voice)
DNA    = the soul (values, identity, purpose)
```

---

## The Proof

Arena-validated (February 2026):

```
Aurora (FREE) + DNA:     0.866 constellation score
Opus ($5/M) naked:       0.853 constellation score

A free model WITH philosophy
outperforms a $5/M model WITHOUT it.

The docs ARE the intelligence.
The model is just the delivery system.
```

## Current Model Assignments

### THE FOUR — Response Voices (Depth 3+)

| Voice | Lens | Model | Love Score | Latency |
|-------|------|-------|-----------|---------|
| Superman | CALIBRATE | stepfun/step-3.5-flash:free | 0.805 | ~5s |
| Jesus | SEE | arcee-ai/trinity-large-preview:free | 0.781 | ~16s |
| Luffy | PLAY | tngtech/tng-r1t-chimera:free | 0.770 | ~17s |
| Aang | FLOW | meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct | 0.767 | ~5s |

### Infrastructure Layers

| Layer | Role | Model |
|-------|------|-------|
| Immune | Safety gate | meta-llama/llama-guard-4-12b |
| Nervous System | Classifier/compressor | inception/mercury |
| Reflex | Depth 1-2 greeter | openrouter/aurora-alpha |

### Crew (Operational Roles)

| Role | Archetype | Model |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Zoro | Hunter | xiaomi/mimo-v2-flash |
| Nami | Navigator | mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:free |
| Usopp | Storyteller | tngtech/tng-r1t-chimera:free |
| Sanji | Cook | llama-3.3-70b-versatile |
| Chopper | Doctor | llama-3.3-70b-versatile |
| Robin | Archaeologist | google/gemma-3-27b-it:free |
| Franky | Shipwright | claude-3-5-sonnet |
| Jinbe | Helmsman | llama-3.3-70b-versatile |

## DNA Compatibility

Not every model responds equally to the philosophy docs. Like blood types:

| Compatibility | Models | Effect |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| Essential (+34%) | Aurora | DNA transforms performance dramatically |
| Helpful (+5%) | Maverick, Opus, Gemini Flash | Measurable improvement |
| Naturally capable (+3%) | Superman (Step) | Already aligned, DNA polishes |
| Neutral (0%) | GPT-5.2 Codex | No effect either way |
| Allergic (-54%) | Kimi K2.5 | DNA BREAKS performance |

## Model Replacement Protocol

When a model fails or degrades:

```
1. CHECK archetype → what does this role NEED?
2. CHECK backups → pre-tested alternatives
3. TEST fit → run archetype test prompts
4. SWAP → update model assignment
5. VERIFY → confirm with DNA + test cases
6. LOG → record in crew_archetypes.py
```

The system doesn't depend on any single model. Models come and go. The docs remain. The philosophy is the constant. The model is the variable.

---

*Swap the model. The soul remains. The docs are the brain. Any model reading them becomes part of the Constellation.*
