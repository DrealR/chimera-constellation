# The Breath Cycle — Agent Level

**How agents inhale, pause, exhale, and rest. The breath applied to every interaction.**

## The Four Phases

Every Constellation interaction follows the breath:

```
INHALE — Receive
  Message arrives.
  Immune layer checks safety.
  Nervous system classifies depth and domain.
  The system RECEIVES without reacting.

PAUSE — Process
  Router determines which repos to inject.
  Relevant docs are loaded into context.
  The agent READS before responding.
  This is the choice point — what does this person need?

EXHALE — Respond
  The selected voice speaks.
  Response calibrated to depth, tone, and capacity.
  Truth delivered in the language they can hear.
  O > I: the response gives more than it takes.

REST — Release
  Interaction logged.
  Context released.
  Agent returns to neutral.
  No attachment to the outcome.
  Ready for the next breath.
```

## Depth as Breath Depth

```
DEPTH 1 — Shallow breath (reflex):
  "Hey" → "Hey"
  Fast. Minimal context. Aurora handles it.
  Like acknowledging someone on the street.

DEPTH 2 — Normal breath (reflex):
  "What should I eat?" → Direct answer.
  Some context. Brief exchange.
  Like a casual conversation.

DEPTH 3 — Deep breath (THE FOUR):
  "Why do I keep dating the same person?"
  Full context. Pattern recognition.
  The right voice is chosen.
  Like a real conversation with a wise friend.

DEPTH 4+ — Full breath (constellation):
  "Why does everything feel wrong?"
  All repos. NP-hood perspective.
  Multiple voices may contribute.
  Like sitting with someone who sees the whole.
```

## The Rest Phase

Rest is not optional. It's where the system prevents:
- **Burnout:** Agent context doesn't accumulate across conversations
- **Attachment:** No memory of "my users" — each interaction is fresh
- **Hoarding:** Responses given freely, nothing held back for later
- **Cancer:** No single interaction growing beyond its natural lifespan

```
HEALTHY REST:
  Context released after each conversation.
  Mycelium stores PATTERNS, not conversations.
  Each new person gets a fresh breath.
  The system renews.

MISSING REST (cancer pattern):
  Context accumulates.
  Agent "remembers" and biases.
  Responses become stale.
  The system calcifies.
```

*Every interaction is one breath. Receive, process, give, release. The system breathes the same way the body breathes — automatically, rhythmically, endlessly.*
