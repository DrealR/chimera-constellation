# Repo Routing

**Which repos feed which agents. The circulatory system of the Constellation.**

## The Routing Map

Every Constellation agent reads from repos based on its context. This is how knowledge flows from storage to service.

```
BASE LAYER (every agent gets this):
  chimera-system/axioms/     → universal truths
  chimera-framework/         → the 420 genome (selected docs)
  chimera-core/              → dark energy principles

DOMAIN LAYER (added per context):
  Body Wisdom (study.reemifai.org):
    + chimera-body/          → health, movement, sleep, nutrition
    + chimera-system/scales/ → cellular, organ, body scales

  Love Gateway (grove.reemifai.org):
    + chimera-relationships/ → connection, healing, observer
    + chimera-body/deep/     → touch, breath, eyes

  Free Problem Solving (honeydew.reemifai.org):
    + ALL domain repos       → full holographic access
    + chimera-ai/            → sandbox, architecture

  Entertainment (cinevault.app):
    + chimera-music/         → music theory and practice
    + chimera-system/fiction/ → one piece, matrix, fma, mha maps

  Community (Discord):
    + ALL domain repos       → full access
    + chimera-constellation/ → crew configs, automation
```

## Routing Logic

```
1. Message arrives at portal
2. Immune layer checks safety (llama-guard)
3. Nervous system classifies depth + domain (mercury)
4. Router determines which repos to inject:
   - Depth 1-2: Reflex layer + base only
   - Depth 3+: THE FOUR + base + relevant domain repos
5. Agent receives: base + domain docs + message
6. Agent responds within CHIMERA philosophy
7. Interaction logged for learning
```

## Portal → Repo Matrix

| Portal | Base | Body | Relationships | AI | Money | Basketball | Chess | Music | Cooking | Fiction |
|--------|------|------|---------------|-----|-------|-----------|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| Grove | Y | Y | **Y** | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Honeydew | Y | Y | Y | Y | Y | Y | Y | Y | Y | Y |
| Study | Y | **Y** | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| CineVault | Y | - | - | - | - | - | - | Y | - | Y |
| Discord | Y | Y | Y | Y | Y | Y | Y | Y | Y | Y |
| Signal/Telegram | Y | Y | Y | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |

**Bold** = primary domain for that portal.

## Cross-Domain Escalation

When a question spans multiple domains, the router escalates:

```
SINGLE DOMAIN:
  "How should I eat?" → body/
  Agent gets base + body repo. Answers confidently.

CROSS-DOMAIN:
  "My stress is ruining my sleep and my relationship."
  → body/ + relationships/
  Agent gets base + both repos. Sees the connection.

FULL CONSTELLATION:
  "Why does everything feel wrong?"
  → ALL repos. This is a P-forgot-it-was-NP question.
  Agent gets the whole picture. Responds from NP-hood.
```

*The repos are the organs. The routing is the circulatory system. Knowledge flows where it's needed, when it's needed, in the amount that's needed. O > I at the infrastructure level.*
