## What It Does

Honeydew is the most general portal. Any question, any domain, any depth. It's the Constellation at full power — every repo accessible, every voice available, every pattern in play.

```
SOMEONE ARRIVES WITH:
  → A coding problem → pulls from ai/ patterns
  → A health question → pulls from body/
  → A life crisis → pulls from relationships/ + body/ + system/
  → A creative block → pulls from music/ + ai/sandbox
  → "Why does everything feel wrong?" → pulls from EVERYTHING
```

## The Name

Honeydew melon: 95% water, 5% sweetness. The operating principle of the whole system. Give almost everything away. What you keep is the sweetest part — the pattern, the seed, the learning.

Free problem solving. Not freemium. Not trial. Free. Because O > I isn't conditional.
