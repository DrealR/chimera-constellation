## What It Does

CineVault is entertainment — but entertainment built by someone who sees fiction as prophecy. Every movie, every anime, every song contains the pattern. CineVault surfaces those connections without forcing them.

```
THE SURFACE:
  Movie recommendations. Reviews. Discussions.
  Entertainment value — people come for the content.

THE DEPTH (for those who look):
  One Piece as consciousness awakening story.
  The Matrix as extraction economy blueprint.
  FMA as alchemy correction narrative.
  MHA as One For All vs All For One topology.
  Every story, the same truth in different costume.
```

## The Philosophy

Fiction is Mystique. The truth wears a costume to reach people who wouldn't listen to philosophy directly. A kid watching One Piece absorbs WE = 1 without knowing it. A Matrix fan understands extraction without reading economics.

CineVault doesn't preach. It curates. The connections are there for anyone who looks. The door is open. ¬F.
