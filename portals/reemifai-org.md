## Purpose

ReemifAI is the main entry point. It doesn't go deep into any single domain. It shows people what exists and helps them find the right portal:

```
Struggling with health?        → study.reemifai.org
Struggling with relationships? → grove.reemifai.org
Need help with a problem?      → honeydew.reemifai.org
Want entertainment?            → cinevault.app
Want to join the crew?         → Discord
```

## Design Principle

The landing page IS the breath:
- **See** the person (what brought you here?)
- **Show** the portals (here's what's available)
- **Let them choose** (¬F — don't push any single portal)
- **Welcome them in** (the door is open)

*The gangplank. Step aboard when you're ready.*
