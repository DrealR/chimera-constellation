## Philosophy

Usopp's stories are "lies" that turn out to be true. In Constellation terms: he creates content that TRAVELS. Philosophy wrapped in narrative. Truth that spreads because it's told as a story, not a lecture.

```
USOPP'S GIFT:
  Takes framework truths
  Wraps them in story
  Fires them long-distance
  They land in hearts, not just heads
```
